# 🚀 Hive-Mind Copilot Workflows

**⚡ Turn GitHub Copilot into a disciplined multi-agent engineering system.**

This repo gives you a ready-to-adapt control plane for VS Code Agents:

- 🧭 one strong user-facing orchestrator instead of agent chaos
- 🧠 structured planning with tracks, epics, readiness gates, and plan deltas
- 🕵️ hidden specialist workers for coding, review, debugging, and discovery
- 🧰 reusable internal skills instead of bloated prompts
- 🗂️ template-based durable memory that downstream projects can safely adopt

**🔥 Clone it, adapt it, and use it as a serious foundation for agentic delivery — not a demo prompt pack.**

## 🔥 Why this is FIRE

- **🧠 Memory That Doesn’t Rot the Repo**: Durable knowledge goes to `.agent-memory/`; draft plans, breadcrumbs, and temporary context stay in session memory. You keep the benefits of memory without polluting a reusable open-source template.
- **🎛️ One Real Control Plane**: `Orchestrator` owns routing, review, debug loops, memory decisions, worktree strategy, and `/delegate` boundaries. This is not “a bag of agents” — it is a governed system.
- **🕵️ Hidden Discovery Engine**: `Explore` gives you fast broad-to-narrow scouting, plus parallel `x2` / `x3` discovery for multi-surface tasks, while staying invisible to end users who should not call internal workers directly.
- **📐 Planning With Structure**: `Planner` works with explicit tracks — `Quick Change`, `Feature Track`, `System Track` — and produces plans with scope, slices/epics, dependencies, verification, gaps/defaults, and Multi-Hive decisions.
- **🛡️ Readiness Gates Before Code**: The system can block execution with `Implementation Readiness: BLOCKED` when scope is fuzzy, dependencies are missing, or verification is weak. It prefers clarity over fake momentum.
- **🔁 Plan Delta, Not Plan Thrash**: When scope changes mid-flight, the workflow can emit a `Plan Delta` instead of throwing away the whole plan and starting from zero.
- **🤖 Multi-Hive That Actually Scales**: For larger work, you can combine planning decomposition, hidden specialist agents, git worktrees for filesystem isolation, and `/delegate` for session isolation.

## What Changed

Recent model updates (as of 2026-03-19):

- `CoderJr` uses **GPT-5.4 mini** for small, low-risk implementation work.
- `Debuger` uses **GPT-5.4** for diagnose, and fix concrete bugs in existing code.

## Agent Model

### User-facing agents

- `.github/agents/orchestrator.agent.md:1` — main entrypoint for execution, routing, review, and completion control
- `.github/agents/planner.agent.md:1` — user-facing planning agent for discovery, clarification, and execution-ready plans

### Hidden internal agents

- `.github/agents/explore.agent.md:1` — fast read-only scouting
- `.github/agents/coder-jr.agent.md:1` — smaller implementation tasks
- `.github/agents/coder-sr.agent.md:1` — complex implementation tasks
- `.github/agents/designer.agent.md:1` — UI-only implementation
- `.github/agents/reviewer.agent.md:1` — single-review path
- `.github/agents/reviewer-gpt.agent.md:1` — review subagent
- `.github/agents/reviewer-gemini.agent.md:1` — review subagent
- `.github/agents/multi-reviewer.agent.md:1` — consolidates multi-review output
- `.github/agents/debugger.agent.md:1` — reproducible bug diagnosis and fix flow

All internal agents are hidden with `user-invocable: false` and guarded with `disable-model-invocation: true`.

## Control Plane

### Orchestrator

`Orchestrator` is the sole control plane:

- never writes code directly
- performs only lightweight triage, routing, and governance
- delegates all file changes to coding/debug agents
- routes by task type and planning track
- decides when to use review, debug, worktrees, and `/delegate`
- enforces memory-write policy for durable outcomes

`Orchestrator` is not a deep problem-framing agent:

- do not perform deep diagnosis, architecture design, or decomposition inside `Orchestrator`
- do not resolve ambiguous intent inside `Orchestrator` beyond minimal routing triage
- escalate immediately to `Planner` when the request has ambiguity, architectural choice, non-trivial decomposition, or unclear implementation readiness

It uses an explicit `agents` allowlist rather than implicit agent fan-out.

### Planner

`Planner` is the planning gatekeeper:

- clarifies ambiguous requests
- runs discovery directly or through `Explore`
- selects one planning track:
  - `Quick Change`
  - `Feature Track`
  - `System Track`
- emits structured plans with:
  - objective
  - scope
  - epics or feature slices
  - dependencies
  - verification
  - gaps and defaults
  - multi-hive decision
  - implementation readiness

`Planner` does not implement code.

### Explore

`Explore` is a hidden read-only subagent used when discovery materially improves routing or planning.

Routing policy:

- `SKIP` when owner and file scope are already clear
- `AUTO x1` for one primary research track
- `PARALLEL x2` for two mostly independent research tracks
- `PARALLEL x3` only for larger multi-surface planning or multi-hive decomposition

## Planning Model

Planning now follows explicit structure instead of ad hoc step lists.

### Tracks

- `Quick Change` — localized low-ambiguity work
- `Feature Track` — medium work with a few moving parts
- `System Track` — architecture, integration, or multi-surface work

### Required planning concepts

- `Clarification Status`
- `Planning Track`
- `Objective`
- `Scope`
- `Epics` or `Feature Slices`
- `Ordered implementation steps`
- `Verification`
- `Implementation Readiness`
- `Memory Update`
- `Multi-Hive Decision`
- `Gaps and Proposed Defaults`
- `Documentation Artifacts` for larger system work

### Readiness gate

Execution should not start unless the plan is ready:

- scope is stable enough
- affected areas are known
- dependencies are known
- verification is concrete
- critical gaps are resolved

If not, the plan must return `Implementation Readiness: BLOCKED`.

### Plan delta

If scope changes after a plan already exists, the preferred behavior is a `Plan Delta`:

- what changed
- what remains valid
- what steps are removed
- what new steps are added
- whether routing or readiness changed

### Planning flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S["Request"] --> T["Select track"]

    T --> Q["Quick Change"]
    T --> F["Feature Track"]
    T --> SY["System Track"]

    Q --> D1["Localized steps + verification"]
    F --> D2["Feature slices + dependencies + risks"]
    SY --> D3["Epics + features + artifacts + dependencies"]

    D1 --> G["Gaps / defaults check"]
    D2 --> G
    D3 --> G

    G --> READY{"Implementation Readiness"}
    READY -- "PASS" --> PLAN["Execution-ready plan"]
    READY -- "BLOCKED" --> STOP["Clarify / discover more"]

    PLAN --> CHANGE{"Scope changed later?"}
    CHANGE -- "No" --> EXECUTE["Execute"]
    CHANGE -- "Yes" --> DELTA["Plan Delta"]
    DELTA --> READY
```

## Execution and Routing

### Default routing

- planning / ambiguity / architecture / decomposition → `Planner`
- fast scouting → `Explore`
- small implementation → `CoderJr`
- complex implementation → `CoderSr`
- UI-only implementation → `Designer`
- review / audit → `Reviewer` or multi-review path
- reproducible failure → `Debugger`

Routing rule:

- if the request is ambiguous, requires architectural judgment, needs decomposition, or is not implementation-ready, `Orchestrator` must hand off to `Planner` instead of framing the problem itself

### Review paths

- single review → `Reviewer`
- multi-review → `ReviewerGPT` + `ReviewerGemini` + `Reviewer` in parallel, then `MultiReviewer`

### `/delegate`

Use `/delegate` for stable phase handoff when session isolation is useful:

- long-running implementation
- terminal-heavy work
- debugging loops
- larger multi-file refactors
- multi-hive branches

Do not use `/delegate` for trivial microtasks.

## Memory Model

The repository uses a two-layer memory model:

- durable memory in `.agent-memory/project_decisions.md:1` and `.agent-memory/error_patterns.md:1`
- session memory in `vscode/memory`

Rules:

- durable project knowledge goes only into `.agent-memory/`
- session notes, draft plans, and temporary breadcrumbs stay in `vscode/memory`
- draft epics, tentative feature breakdowns, and plan deltas are not durable by default

For this open-source repository, `.agent-memory/` is committed as a template:

- instructions and entry templates stay in git
- project-specific memory entries should be added only in downstream projects
- reusable template repos should keep these files empty except for guidance

    VM --> V3["Temporary breadcrumbs"]

    DM --> D1["project_decisions.md"]

    DM --> D3["archive/"]

    V1 -. "not durable" .-> X1["Do not commit as project truth"]

    V3 -. "not durable" .-> X1

    D1 --> Y["Durable repo knowledge"]
    D2 --> Y
    D3 --> Y
```

## Worktrees and Multi-Hive

Use git worktrees when parallel tasks require filesystem isolation, especially if overlapping files make normal parallel delegation unsafe.

Use Multi-Hive only when it is justified by the task:

- multiple independent subsystems
- high conflict risk
- high task volume
- strong need for environment isolation

Worktrees and `/delegate` solve different problems:

- worktrees provide filesystem isolation
- `/delegate` provides session isolation

They can be combined.

## Recommended Adoption

If you clone this repository into another project:

1. keep `.agent-memory/*.md` as templates initially
2. customize agent instructions for your repo structure and tooling
3. expose only the agents you want users to call directly
4. keep internal workers and skills hidden by default
5. tune planning tracks and review thresholds for your project size
